    Note: this is a post describing how I decided on the QR authorization code schema for
    a Flutter app I wrote - if you're interested in the use case, see the post <a [routerLink] = "['/blog', 'flutterapp1']"> here </a>
  </div>
  <div class = "paragraph">
    My goals for creating an authorization schema were as follows:
    <ul>
      <li> Fast </li>
      <li> Self-validating </li>
      <li> Able to store metadata </li>
    </ul>
    With this in mind, I did some research and discovered that QR codes were able to store
    quite a bit of data (<a href="https://www.qrcode.com/en/about/standards.html">2,000 characters for a mid-size code</a>)
    so all the information required for validation could be stored in the code itself - this would make it <b>fast</b>, as no
    external data source would need to be queried to verify the composition of the code itself. After some deliberation with
    a friend, I came up with a schema that would entail the uniqueness of codes:
  </div>
  <div class="blogsingleimage">
    <img src = "assets/blogAssets/authschema/authschema.png" width="90%">
  </div>
  <div class = "paragraph">
    By hashing the lexicographical sum of the characters in the event ID + the codes issued # (total codes issued for the event at the time of generation + 1),
    no 2 codes for any given event could be identical, as the issued number guaranteed uniqueness, and the event id served as the salt
    for the hash.  While this is not cryptographically very strong, for a frat party it is *good enough*, as even if you happened to be
    code #10 for last weekend's party and this weekend's party, your hash would be significantly different. This makes it <b>self-validating</b>.
    We can also then just append the rest of the information we want to the code, confusing possible attackers but making it easily parsed.
    This makes it <b>able to store metadata</b>. 
    The code to validate the composition of the QR code then looks something like this:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">/**
* @param {{'{'}}data{{'}'}} formatted string into object by helper method
**/</code><code class="language-typescript">
export let qrValidate = (data: IQRData): boolean => {{'{'}}
    return sha256(
      (sumEventId(data.eventID) + data.issuedNumber).toString()
    ) === data.hash;
{{'}'}};</code></pre>
  </div>
  <div class = "paragraph">
    An observant reader might say
    "That's pretty easy to figure out (especially now that you've told us), why not just scrape the event id from a friend's code,
    pick a really high issued # that can't possibly conflict with the 100 or so people invited to the party, and generate codes at will."
  </div>
  <div class = "paragraph">
    Well, there's
    a log in the database that contains how many total codes have been issued, so when the db is finally queried to check if the code has been scanned,
    we can check if issued > total issued - this makes it so you have to generate a code that will conflict with someone else, making it a possibility
    that at the door your code will show up as already scanned if the legitimate recipient is already inside - shame on you.  IF you manage to get lucky,
    and were smart enough to figure out the schema on an app intended to only see the light of day in front of an interview board, then maybe you deserve
    to get in and let the unlucky person who's code you *stole* try to convince the door-person that they "are totally on the list bro".
